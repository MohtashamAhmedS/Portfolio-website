        <h1>How I Learned Front-end Development</h1>
        <p class="blog-para">
          I began learning front-end development in 2019, but I didn't continue
          it for some reason. It wasn't until December 2020 that I started
          taking front-end seriously. Now, I can create professional-looking
          front-end websites. If you're thinking about learning front-end
          development, you first need to understand what front-end is. The
          front-end is what you see when you open a website or a web page. As
          the name suggests, it's the front of the website. When you open a
          website, you see a beautiful web page built using three main
          technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>HTML:</strong> The text you usually see on a site.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>CSS:</strong> Makes the text look beautiful, like makeup for
            your webpage.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>JavaScript:</strong> Adds interactivity, such as popups when
            you click a button.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Web Development Roadmaps</h2>
        <p class="blog-para">
          To start, like everyone else, I followed roadmaps. Here are the three
          main components of front-end development:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="blog-para">
          Don't be overwhelmed by having to learn three languages. Yes, you need
          to learn them, but there's an efficient way to do so, which will also
          make the journey enjoyable.
        </p>

        <h2>Learning HTML</h2>
        <p class="blog-para">
          HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It's like the body of a car
          – just a structure, the building block of a website. HTML is the
          easiest language I've learned so far. You don't need to learn every
          HTML tag. I’ve been coding in HTML for over two years, and I don’t
          know every tag. Focus on understanding the concepts and how tags are
          used. The more you code, the more you learn. Aim to learn about 70% of
          HTML, which is more than enough.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-para">
          <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Googling is one of the most important skills
          while learning programming. You can't learn every piece of every
          language, so understanding the concept allows you to find solutions
          online.
        </p>

        <h2>Learning CSS</h2>
        <p class="blog-para">
          CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. If HTML is the skeleton of a
          website, CSS is the design. Any design you see on a webpage is mostly
          done with CSS. I heard CSS was hard when I started, but I found it
          enjoyable. To get better at CSS, or any language, you need to code
          more. Start by learning about 60% of CSS and increase your knowledge
          over time.
        </p>

        <h2>Learning JavaScript</h2>
        <p class="blog-para">
          If JavaScript is your first programming language, it might be a bit
          challenging initially. I recommend learning about 50% of it at first.
          You can create beautiful websites without JavaScript, but JavaScript
          adds functionality like buttons and animations using libraries.
          Remember, practice is crucial. If you feel frustrated, take a break,
          create a project, or copy an existing one to understand it better.
          This will boost your motivation.
        </p>

        <h2>Starting Projects</h2>
        <p class="blog-para">
          Once you have learned enough HTML and CSS, start creating projects.
          Initially, I didn’t know how to create a navbar or other elements. I
          watched project videos and coded along with them. This practice helped
          me understand and modify different elements with HTML and CSS.
          Understanding the concept is the key to learning web development.
        </p>
